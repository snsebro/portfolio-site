        Iâ€™m a creative, collaborative, and thoughtful software engineer with a
        diverse range of experiences that have taught me to combine strong
        aesthetic vision with the practical application of technology stacks to
        produce apps that are scalable, efficient, and visually stimulating.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a lifetime learner I look forward broadening my skill sets with each
        project I take on and always remain open to new challenges.
